This is a capstone project that we are working on as a team, the system for all of our code and interactions.

### Our Goal
The provided code will be organized, commented, and user-friendly to allow for the ultimate configuration based on needs and systems. This is our goal as the members working on this project, to ensure that it is robust and well-rounded, allowing those without prior coding knowledge to make changes to suit their needs.
